# Analyzing-BIXI-Ridership-With-Data
If you live or work in the city, you’ve probably passed by one of the 700 BIXI stations. And you’ve undoubtedly come across “BIXISTS,” i.e., cyclists riding one of the grey bikes (or perhaps a blue bike). That’s BIXI. It is a hybrid between "BIcycle" and "TaXI" to underline the concept of being able to use a bicycle just like a taxi. While it has been growing in popularity, we thought it will be a good opportunity to analyze various aspects of Bixi Data especially from Montreal. The goal is to find results which can then help improve its quality of the service, find Bixi stations and other services that will benefit the customer. We will be using open datasets for this purpose.
